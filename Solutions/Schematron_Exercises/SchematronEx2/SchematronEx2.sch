  <!--2016-02-21 ebb:The next two patterns help to show how @xml:ids can function in a project. We make a standard list of unique identifiers for people, places, books, witnesses to a text somewhere, perhaps in the TEI header or perhaps in a separate file. That way we can point to those identifiers as a handy abbreviation whenever we are referring to them, as many times as we need to in the document. Each xml:id must be unique, so its value cannot be used more than once. In the body of your project files, you can point to that identifier as many times as you need to in *other* attributes (like @wit, @ref, etc.) by placing a hashtag in front of the xml:id (so you are not reusing the xml;id). 
The two Schematron patterns below provide a way to ensure you are preparing xml:ids without hashtags or white spaces. That's important because we *want to be able to use hashtags and white spaces* in the body of the documents when we need to point to the xml;id in yoru list of unique identifiers. We use white spaces when we need to refer to multiple entries in our list, like this:

<listPerson>
<person xml:id="benthamJ">
   <persName><surname>Bentham</surname>
   <forename>Jeremy</forename>
   </persName>
   <persName type="alias">Some Dude<persName>
   <. . .more info and tags to describe the person, perhaps birth and death dates, a biographical note etc.. . .>
<person>
<person xml:id="dickinsonE">
   <persName><surname>Dickinson</surname>
   <forename>Emily</forename>
   </persName>
  <. . .more info and tags to describe the person, perhaps birth and death dates, a biographical note etc.. . .>
<person>

In the homework, we prepared a list of editions with bibliography information about each, in a listWit or a list of witnesses, each one holding distinct identifying information about a different "witness" or editors' representation of Emily Dickinson's manuscript poems. Each edition produced distinct "variants" or different readings of the same document, as the editors "normalized" and changed Dickinson's poems in the different published editions. The Dickinson team needed to mark the different variants of particular lines in each poem, so they referred to the source of each variant by its unique identifier. They need a way to make sure they always type those in accurately, and for that we use the following two patterns, which you should feel free to adapt to your own projects!
  -->
        <rule context="@xml:id">
            <report test="starts-with(., '#')">
                xml:id attributes must not begin with a hashtag!
            </report>
            <report test="matches(., '\s+')">
                @xml:id values may NOT contain white spaces!
            </report>       
        </rule>
    </pattern>
    <pattern>
        <!-- Question 4 EXPANDED -->
        <rule context="@wit">
            <let name="tokens" value="for $w in tokenize(., '\s+') return substring-after($w, '#')"/>
            <assert test="every $token in $tokens satisfies $token = //tei:TEI//tei:listWit//@xml:id">
                Every reading witness (@wit) after the hashtag must match an xml:id defined in the list of witnesses in this file!
            </assert>
  <!--2016-02-21 ebb: This rule permits us to use white space as a separator, so we can refer to multiple published editions that represent a particular variant in the text. We format that like so: <rdg wit="#df16 #fh #poems2"> (so this refers to three different editions, identified up in the TEI header by the xml:ids: df16, fh, and poems. 
      This does several things you've not seen before: 
      1) The "let" statement: This defines a *variable* in Schematron, and gives it a name ("tokens") which we can quickly refer to with a dollar-sign in front of it ("$token"). We can define a variable inside a rule to make it local (in which case the parser only "knows" about it and reads it within the context of a particular rule), OR we can define it *globally* and set it outside the patterns so it can be invoked everywhere. We make global variables when we need to write Schematron rules that point to other files, to see if a value of an attribute matches an xml:id defined in a separate project file, for example.  
      
      2) Dealing with multiple values: First, in our variable, we tokenized our @wit attribute on white space, and that created multiple values or token. So if we *do* use one or more white spaces in a @wit attribute, we use those white spaces as a dividing point: we separate the value into "tokens": so <rdg wit="#ce #poems2 #fh"> would be tokenized into three pieces. Our language, "for $w in tokenize(., '\s+'), defines a separate variable *for each one of these tokens*, since we need to look at them one by one. For each of these, we need to cut off the leading hashtag, so we do one more thing: return the substring-after($w, '#').
This creates three tokens in this format: 
      token 1: ce
      token 2: poems2
      token 3: fh
Now our assert test needs to do something more, so it can deal with a situation in which there's only one token OR multiple tokens. We can't just test ALL the tokens at once against each xml:id: Schematron needs to look at them one at a time: first ce, then poems2, then fh. For that we use this syntax:
<assert test="every $token in $tokens satisfies $token = //tei:TEI//tei:listWit//@xml:id">
The work of this is done by the language "every [singular] in [plural] satisfies [a test you design for the singular value].
