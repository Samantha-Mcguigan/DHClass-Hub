<instructions>
Place all ingredients in a large bowl. Use an immersion blender or blend in batches, to desired smoothness. We prefer our gazpacho somewhat chunky, so only pulse a few times in the blender.

Adjust seasonings to taste.
Place in a non-reactive container (tomatoes are acidic) to store. Chill several hours or overnight to allow the flavors to blend.</instructions></root>
