      <h2>Read The Body Paragraphs of This Letter</h2>
      <p> I am sending a frank to <span class="people">Mrs. Hofland</span> &amp; I cannot help enclosing a note to you to ask if the report in the papers be true
         that Lazarus is sold? I hope it is so--I hope so so earnestly that I can hardly believe it.
      </p>
      <p>Did I tell you that I had had an application from <span class="people">Mr. Elliston</span> for Foscari? which under <span class="people">Mr. Macready</span>'s advice I declined. But the application was flattering--&amp; I trust that under all
         the disadvantage of the execrable acting a great impression has been made by Julian--to have withstood such acting for four nights is something--Is it not?--&amp; if we
         go on in the Easter week I shall  have hopes--&amp; if we do not I shall not despond--for much has been done of that I am confident. The article in the John Bull was what I expected--but that in The Examiner was worse in my mind--Could not you do any thing to procure a short &amp; more favorable
         notice against next Sunday? I ask you just as I would ask a brother--I wish with all
         my heart that any one would write an exposure of that slang of criticisim "Melodramatic"--I
         am sure, as <span class="people">Mr. Macready</span> says, that if any one of the Greek Dramas or  even <span class="people">Shakespeare</span>'s stronger plays, or any thing that is effective were to be produced now, it would
         be afraid by that word.--By the way <span class="people">Mr. Macready</span> and his <span class="people">Sister</span> have  been kind to me beyond all kindness. They are delightful people.
      </p>
      <p>Will you say every thing for me to your lovely wife--&amp; my kind friends <span class="people">Mr. Bewick</span> &amp; <span class="people">Mr. Chatfield</span>? Shall I send you some orders for the Fifth night?Mitford is probably refering to the fifth night of production of her play, Julian, at Covent Garden. An article in the Morning Post lists the fifth night of production as 02 April 1823.--And pray try what you can do with The Examiner.--Ever my dear Sir 
      </p>
      <p>Kind regards from <span class="people">Papa</span> &amp; <span class="people">Mama</span>.
